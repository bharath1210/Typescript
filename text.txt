let value: boolean = true;

let bharath: string = "hello";

let data: Number = 35;

(`) => backtik/backquote ex: ` hi bharath its been good.`;

embedded expression `add is ${data+5} val` is same as.."add is " + data+5 + "val"

let x: Array<string>;
let x: string[];
let x: [string,number]; ...=>tuple type

let x: any;  //it refers to string,number,boolean 

(...) spread operator
eg:
let a = [1,2,3];
let b = [5,6];
let c = [0,...a,4,...b,7] //implies  join of arrays....it doesn't allow in functions

in interface readonly x:number //the x value cannot be changed
let x = [2,3,4,null,undefined]....//it takes best of matches given next value

internal modules are namespaces and external modules are modules

implements means using interface in class which use th value
